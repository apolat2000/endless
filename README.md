# Endless
An attempt to unify the social media experience.

## What is Endless?

## Features

* Save posts
* Upvote posts
* Comment on posts
* Remove upvotes and comments if needed
* Fuzzy search on post titles on feed

## How to contribute?
You can contribute to Endless by adding support for new websites or by improving the existing codebase. If you want to add support for a new website, take a look at the existing websites. Usually, each website has its own class with two methods inside the [extractors.js](src/js/extractors.js) file. If you want to improve the existing codebase, you can do so by creating a pull request.
